# Cagox Media

You have found us!

I will get more information up eventually, but for now, here is a list of Cagox projects of interst.

[My current active project](https://github.com/users/cagox/projects/1) is the rebuilding of the FluxRPG Spell Book website, located at http://spells.fluxrpg.net/. It is my goal to have the new version of the site deployed before the end of 2021. Once that is complete to an acceptable degree, I will move on to finishing my C++ Tetris implementation.
